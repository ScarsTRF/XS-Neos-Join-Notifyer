# XSOverlay-Join-Notifyer
A server for Websockets and Server for XSOverlay notification interactions

Please install Node 16.13.0 (What has been coded and tested on) from the link below.

https://nodejs.org/en/download/

After this then run the Setup.bat to install the required modules for the script.

Once completed you are ready to run start.bat which will launch the program to give XSOverlay Join notifications

Please be aware that this folder should not be moved or deleted as the code runs off the JS file within this folder so it's a recommendation that you were to place this folder in a custom directory on your drive that you won't touch.

You can also install this as a service under Service installers folder and clicking on install.bat do not move the folder after this or the service will break.

If you no longer wish to have it as a service, you can uninstall it with the uninstall.bat.

The logiX for the Notifyer is in my Public folder (Scar Vorrix [Public]) and will more or less change quickly to make it more lightweight on the client and user end. Expect changes please.
